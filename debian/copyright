This is NOT a DEP 5 copyright file. The sch_jens/* Files paragraph shall
apply to the git tree, i.e. the source with debian/patches/debian-changes
applied (though the debian/* match would apply to the patches as well).

Upstream-Name: iproute2
Source: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/net/iproute2/
Comment:
 The former upstream was:
 http://devresources.linuxfoundation.org/dev/iproute2/download/
 http://developer.osdl.org/dev/iproute2
 ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/iproute2-2.4.7-now-ss010824.tar.gz
 .
 The sch_jens/ files were forked off the Linux kernel itself.
 Everything under jens/ was written specifically for this project.

Comment:
 Parts of the code are also available under a 3-clause BSD licence;
 see the individual files (jens_codel*.h) for details.
 .
 The file jens_uapi.h has the following GPL exception:
 .
   NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
 services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
 of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
 Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
 Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the Linux
 kernel) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.
 .
 Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.
 .
