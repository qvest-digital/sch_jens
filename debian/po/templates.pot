"iproute2 can be used to configure and use Virtual Routing and Forwarding "
"(VRF) functionality in the  kernel. This normally requires root permissions, "
"but sometimes it's useful to allow ordinary users to execute commands from "
"inside a virtual routing and forwarding domain. E.g. ip vrf exec examplevrf "
"ping 10.0.0.1"

"The ip command supports dropping capabilities, making an exception for ip "
"vrf exec. The drawback of setting the permissions is that if in the unlikely "
"case of a security critical bug being found before the ip command has "
"dropped capabilities then it could be used by an attacker to gain root "
"permissions. It's up to you to decide about the trade-offs and select the "
"best setting for your system. This will give cap_dac_override, cap_net_admin "
"and cap_sys_admin to /bin/ip."
