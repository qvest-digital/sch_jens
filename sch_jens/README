sch_jens Linux kernel module
────────────────────────────

This module is intended to be used with Debian 10 “buster”,
either stock Linux kernel 4.19 or backports kernel 5.10; it
is also usable with Debian 11 “bullseye” therefore.

Documentation on purpose, etc. tbd.

Differences to fq_codel
───────────────────────

• The “ecn” parameter is always enabled and does not exist.
• The new parameter “markfull” loosely corresponds to the old
  parameter “ce_threshold”: all packets taking at least this
  long to sojourn are ECN CE-marked
• The parameter “markfree” is a fully new concepts: packets
  taking more than this time will be ECN CE-marked based on
  a, currently linear, scale, depending on where in between
  the “markfree” and “markfull” times the sojourn time falls;
  e.g. markfree=5, markfull=15, sojourn=10 → 50% are marked
  (note that the CoDel algorithm of marking packets when the
  “target” time isn’t reached within “interval” still applies)

Live measurement
────────────────

We’re currently intending to measure the following KPIs:

• queue length (integer, ≤ “limit”) every 5 ms
• timestamp (at least µs) and sojourn time (dito) for every packet

This data is passed from kernel to userspace in records structured
as follows via relayfs:

┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ ts (timestamp)                │typ│fNN│ eNN   │ dNN (data)    │
└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘

The .ts (timestamp) member is a 64-bit unsigned integer,
representing the timestamp of this record in nanoseconds
per CLOCK_MONOTONIC (this is not the packet receive time).
This timestamp has no relation to wall-clock time but is
consistent within measurement as it increases monotonically,
pausing when the system is suspended.

The .type member, an 8-bit unsigned integer, indicates
which record it is, i.e. which meaning it has and how
the data members are filled. This is one of:

• TC_JENS_RELAY_SOJOURN (an IP packet’s sojourn time)
• TC_JENS_RELAY_QUEUESZ (amount of packets in the FIFO)

The remaining members are per-record-type data. They are:
• f8 (8-bit unsigned integer)
• e16 (16-bit unsigned integer)
  aliased as e8[2] (8-bit unsigned integer)
• d32 (32-bit unsigned integer)
  aliased as d16[2] (16-bit unsigned integer)
  aliased as d8[4] (8-bit unsigned integer)
Any data members not specified by the record type must not be accessed.

Record types define the following data members:

• TC_JENS_RELAY_SOJOURN:
  – d32 packet sojourn time in 1024 ns units
  – e16 ECN marking range/percentage
    ‣ 0xFFFF = above or equal to markfull
    ‣ 0x0000 = below or equal to markfree
    ‣ anything in between = relative value of chance of marking
      (this currently scales linearly based on the sojourn time
      but may in the future use a gradual approach)
  – f8 bitfield
    ‣ 0:1 ECN bits on enqueue
    ‣ 2:3 ECN bits on dequeue
    ‣   4 if ECN marked from not reaching target within interval
    ‣   5 if ECN marked from markfree/markfull range
    ‣ 6:7 reserved
• TC_JENS_RELAY_QUEUESZ: d32 queue length

Relayfs subbuffers are 64 records or 1 KiB each. There currently
are 1024 subbuffers per CPU (will be made configurable).
