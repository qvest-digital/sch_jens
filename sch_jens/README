sch_jens Linux kernel module
────────────────────────────

This module is intended to be used with Debian 10 “buster”,
either stock Linux kernel 4.19 or backports kernel 5.10; it
is also usable with Debian 11 “bullseye” therefore.

Documentation on purpose, etc. tbd.

Differences to fq_codel
───────────────────────

• The “ecn” parameter is always enabled and does not exist.
• The new parameter “markfull” loosely corresponds to the old
  parameter “ce_threshold”: all packets taking at least this
  long to sojourn are ECN CE-marked
• The parameter “markfree” is a fully new concepts: packets
  taking more than this time will be ECN CE-marked based on
  a, currently linear, scale, depending on where in between
  the “markfree” and “markfull” times the sojourn time falls;
  e.g. markfree=5, markfull=15, sojourn=10 → 50% are marked
  (note that the CoDel algorithm of marking packets when the
  “target” time isn’t reached within “interval” still applies)
